# About
BTCX is an education focused block explorer for Bitcoin. 

There seems to be a large gap between those who understand how Bitcoin works under the hood, and those who don't. I created this project as a way to help shrink that gap.

This block explorer is designed to provide a technical view of Bitcoin blocks, with detailed technical breakdowns of each piece. The project contains multiple layers of granularity for people of all skill levels to improve their understanding of Bitcoin.

If you like this project, please help by fixing issues, or writing educational information. If you've found a bug, please open an issue.

Full demo: Coming Soon!
